Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) (CI/CD). It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

Why Use Jenkins?
==========================
Automates Repetitive Tasks: Automatically runs builds, tests, and deployments.

Supports CI/CD Pipelines: Integrates with Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.

Extensible with Plugins: Has 1,800+ plugins to integrate with various tools.

Easy to Configure: Uses a web-based UI or Jenkinsfile (pipeline as code).


How Jenkins Works
==========================
Developers push code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

Jenkins pulls the latest code and triggers a build.

Jenkins runs tests to verify the code.

If successful, Jenkins deploys the application to a server.



CI WITH JENKINS
========================================================================================

code build and test as soon as developer commit the changes
auto deployment on successful software build and notify the stake holder
notify the errors to the dev team on build failure 

JENKINS MASTER SLAVE
==========================

Jenkins follow the master slave architecture 

there are 2 types of node 
master node and slave nodes

Master node = master node works as a controller , it manages the task executing on the worker nodes 
		all kind of user commands are accepted by the master node and all kind of output given to the user are given by the master node

Worker node = slave node /worker node will work as a execution node ,only work which is to be done by the worker node is the execution 
  		single master node can have multiple slave nodes 
		master node controls the load distribution on the slave nodes 
======================================================================================================

JENKIN JOBS
================================

jobs in Jenkins are the runnable tasks that is controlled by Jenkins 

for each execution task we need to create a Jenkins jobs 

1) FREESTYLE PROJECT
	this is most common type of JOB ,In a freestyle job you can create a job where you can execute multiple commands in a shell or windows bash 

2) PIPELINE
	 these type of project are used to called a workflow which will have some kind of input and produce some output 
	 these project are normally written in DSL

3) multi configuration project 
	 it is similar  to freestyle project but it is more flexible in terms of the environment 
	 where you want to create a project which will be tested on the multiple environment 
    	 it will require specific configuration for each environment
